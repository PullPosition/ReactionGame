# Reaction Timer Game

This is a simple reaction timer game using 4 LEDs and 4 buttons.  
Each LED switches between on and off states for a random amount of time.  
The user must press the corresponding button while the LED is on to turn it off.

The speed of the button press determines the user's score:  
faster reactions earn more points. Pressing a button while the LED is off results in a penalty.

The current score is displayed on an OLED screen in real time.
